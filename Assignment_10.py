#Problem statemnt - Given integer coordinates of three vertices of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate 
#axes, find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the rectangle. In the first test the three given 
#vertices are (1, 4), (1, 6), (7, 4). The fourth vertex is thus (7, 6)

x2, y2 = map(int, input("Enter x and y coordinates of second vertex (x2 y2): ").split())
x3, y3 = map(int, input("Enter x and y coordinates of third vertex (x3 y3): ").split())
